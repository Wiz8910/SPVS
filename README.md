# Semantics Preserving Text Sanitization
Here all my code is included, however you won't be able to run it given the datasets are a bit big to include in github. 
MappingProducers includes the files that produce mappings for the document sets from words  to sense using various algorithms described in the paper.
Preprocess inlcudes file that stems and tokenizes the document set
Experiment includes the file that performs bisecting kmeans on the produced mappings 
If you want to actually use this code email me at acbqbd@mst.edu and i can get you the whole java project and data
